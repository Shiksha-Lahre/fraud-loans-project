# Credit & Fraud Risk Analytics System
Project overview

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Credit & Fraud Risk Analytics System designed to showcase data engineering, big-data processing, machine learning, deployment, and reporting for two parallel but related use-cases:

- **Fraud Detection (transaction-level)** — using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (PCA-transformed) to detect fraudulent transactions in (near) real-time.

- **Credit Risk Scoring (customer-level)** — using a synthetic/loan dataset to predict loan default probability for applicants.
