# Credit & Fraud Risk Analytics System
Project overview

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Credit & Fraud Risk Analytics System designed to showcase data engineering, big-data processing, machine learning, deployment (future events), and reporting for two parallel but related use-cases:

- **Fraud Detection (transaction-level)** — using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (PCA-transformed) to detect fraudulent transactions in (near) real-time.

- **Credit Risk Scoring (customer-level)** — using a synthetic/loan dataset to predict loan default probability for applicants.

## Motivation

Financial services require two complementary risk systems: one that protects the business from fraudulent transactions (fast, transaction-level detection) and one that scores credit risk of customers (applicant-level decisions). This project demonstrates both systems, end-to-end, with a focus on scalability, interpretability, and production-readiness.
